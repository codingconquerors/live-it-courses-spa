        "description": "We offer online courses purely based on live classes. During these live classes, we understand the existing level of students' knowledge and experience, and the transformation starts from there. This is exactly the opposite of learning through recorded lectures which normally take a lot longer to complete and do not clear your doubts. We clear your doubts instantly and help you achieve your goals rapidly. We believe that no student is weak, it is just the gap in the level of understanding between a student and a teacher which makes things complicated. Our live classes fill all the gaps.",
