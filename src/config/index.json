        "description": "We believe in the notion that no student is a bad student, it is just the gap in level of understanding a student and a teacher has which makes things complicated. We offer online courses purely based on live classes. During these live classe We reach to the level of understanding a student has and the evolution process starts from there. This is exactly opposite of learning through recorded lectures which first takes a lot longer to complete and second if student stucks at some problem it takes forever to resolve.",
